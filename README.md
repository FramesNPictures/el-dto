## Introduction

In computer science, data objects are abstract representations of data that can be manipulated by a computer program.
They are used to model real-world entities, and can be thought of as a way of organizing and structuring data.

In object-oriented programming, data objects are known as objects and are modeled as instances of classes. Classes
define the structure and behavior of objects, and objects are instances of classes that represent specific instances of
data. This allows for the creation of complex data structures and the implementation of complex algorithms.

Overall, data objects play a crucial role in modern programming style by providing a way to represent, manipulate,
and process data. They are used in a wide range of applications, from databases and web applications to scientific
simulations and artificial intelligence systems.
